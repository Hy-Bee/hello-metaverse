# hello-metaverse
Me completing my GitHub tutorial.

I am happy to say I have been enrolled in the Plutus Pioneers Cohort#3. Wide horizons ahead ;)

I am an old(er) Network Architect/Engineer. I also held several IPSEC certs with CheckPoint, ISS, ComputerAssociates, etc... Like many of us experienced "technologists" (love this new label), at one time or another I have either taken courses or my responsibilites have required me to dabble in everything from BASIC to Assembly Language, a few big gulps of SQL for GIS/GPS and general business applications, and of course a few sites in HTML(5 and CSS) and dashes of Python, and javascript to round things out.

If you have read this far, Much appreciated. I hope to be committing as much as possible moving forward.
